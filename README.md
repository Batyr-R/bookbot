# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot is a simple program that gives a number of words and characters in a book(or any txt file).

Usage:
1. On your CLI open the directory of the project
2. Write 'python3 main.py /path/to/your/txt'
If python3 is not installed check out [bootdev's lesson](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/d2371c4c-0dad-4c85-9d4f-e92da72335f6) on it

Thank you.
